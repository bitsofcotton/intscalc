# intscalc
With supposing invariant, get the hidden input as PRNG generated.

# Description
We suppose \<a\_k,x\> ~= 0 for k := (x nonzero bit count) in first binary digit meaning with dim a\_k == accuracy(a\_k) == 2,761,361 case.
We spread unknown inputs except for each of targetted bit as PRNG generated, then get the results.
Also this is too large to calculate on memory, so is through disk access.
